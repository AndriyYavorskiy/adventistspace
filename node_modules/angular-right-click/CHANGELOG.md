# angular-right-click changelog

## v0.1.1 (02-20-2017)
- Fixed issue with `ng-strict-di`

## v0.1.0 (04-15-2016)
- Support for callback only usage (no context menu, only callback on right click) with `ng-right-click='callback'`. The intent is to make it more natural and compatible like `ng-click`.
- Supports context menu after passing menu options with `menu-items` attribute, along with callback.
- Support for custom menu styling using `menu-class` attribute.
